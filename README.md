# Traffic-Video-Detection
Yes! This is a fantastic project for your traffic perception and AI engineer goals. It will demonstrate real-time object detection, classification, occupancy tracking, and bit-based data logging‚Äîall of which align with the job description. Here‚Äôs how we can build it in a week.

üö¶ Project: AI-Powered Traffic Classifier with Zone-Based Occupancy Tracking

Objective

Develop an AI system that:
	‚Ä¢	Detects and classifies pedestrians, cars, bikes, and buses.
	‚Ä¢	Monitors a specific detection zone.
	‚Ä¢	Logs a binary occupancy timeline (e.g., 000000111110000011111), where:
	‚Ä¢	1 means the detection zone is occupied.
	‚Ä¢	0 means the detection zone is empty.
	‚Ä¢	Each bit represents 1/4 of a second.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

‚úÖ ML Frameworks: YOLOv8 (for object detection)
‚úÖ Programming: Python (ML), C++ (real-time optimization)
‚úÖ Computer Vision: OpenCV (for zone tracking)
‚úÖ Inference Acceleration: TensorRT (for real-time speedup)
‚úÖ Deployment: ONNX (to run on edge devices like Jetson Nano)
‚úÖ Data Logging: SQLite or CSV (for storing occupancy timelines)
‚úÖ Visualization: Matplotlib (for plotting zone occupancy over time)

To activate python environment:
use : source my_env/bin/activate & to Deactivate use 'deacticvate'


üìÖ 1-Week Project Plan

Day 1: Dataset Preparation & Model Setup
	‚Ä¢	Use COCO dataset (has pedestrian, car, bike, bus labels)
	‚Ä¢	Use YOLOv8 (pretrained model for object detection)
	‚Ä¢	Fine-tune the model if needed for better accuracy
	‚Ä¢	Define ‚Äúdetection zone‚Äù using OpenCV region-of-interest (ROI)

Day 2: Object Detection & Classification
	‚Ä¢	Implement real-time YOLOv8 inference
	‚Ä¢	Draw bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects
	‚Ä¢	Filter detections within the defined zone

Day 3: Zone-Based Tracking & Occupancy Encoding
	‚Ä¢	Check if any detected object is within the zone
	‚Ä¢	Maintain a rolling occupancy log (000000111110000011111)
	‚Ä¢	Store data in SQLite / CSV for later analysis

Day 4: Real-Time Performance Optimization
	‚Ä¢	Convert YOLOv8 to ONNX + TensorRT for real-time inference
	‚Ä¢	Use multi-threading (C++) for faster processing
	‚Ä¢	Reduce detection latency for real-world deployment

Day 5: Data Visualization & Logging
	‚Ä¢	Plot occupancy timelines using Matplotlib
	‚Ä¢	Compute average occupancy duration for different classes
	‚Ä¢	Generate heatmaps for analysis

Day 6: Edge Device Deployment (Optional)
	‚Ä¢	Run model on Jetson Nano / Raspberry Pi
	‚Ä¢	Optimize for low-SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power) constraints
	‚Ä¢	Test accuracy vs. performance trade-offs

Day 7: Testing & Documentation
	‚Ä¢	Test with real-world video / traffic footage
	‚Ä¢	Create a demo video
	‚Ä¢	Document findings & code
	‚Ä¢	Upload to GitHub with detailed README

üöÄ Expected Outcomes

‚úî Real-time pedestrian, car, bike, bus detection
‚úî Zone-based occupancy tracking (binary encoding)
‚úî Data logging for traffic analysis
‚úî Optimized inference for real-time applications
‚úî Edge-device deployable solution

Would you like some starter code to kick things off? I can provide a YOLOv8 inference script with zone tracking! üö¶üìπ
